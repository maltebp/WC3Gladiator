### Currently working on...
1. Focus on creating rounds up to round 15 (release 0.2a)
2. Creating a missile system, which I need before I can finish a specific round (see repo [here](https://github.com/maltebp/MissileSystem))
3. _On hold:_ Designing and rough implementation code for the new combat system. Check it out and bring me your feedback [here](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/ideas-feedback-for-combat-system.312212/)! :smile:



## Map Concept
A Hero survival/defense map, where you have to survive by killing all monsters in the arena in series of rounds. But beware: this is not your typical item-focused survival. This map introduces unique round mechanics and a (soon-to-be-implemented) custom made combat-system and to spice things up a bit!


## This Repo
As this map's triggers are coded entirely in [WurstScript](https://wurstlang.org), this repo contains the *entire*, and updated, map. It also serves as my *planning* platform, as well as a notepad for ideas and problems in the map (*[see issues](https://github.com/maltebp/WC3Gladiator/issues) and [projects](https://github.com/maltebp/WC3Gladiator/projects)*).
So you can follow me on this repo to keep track of the development of the map.
